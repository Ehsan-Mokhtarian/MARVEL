The function MARVEL.m is the main function of the algorithm. The input/output arguments are described in detail inside the file. It uses the function "CI_Test.m" to perform the required CI tests.
The function CI_Test.m is designed to perform two types of CI tests: 1) Oracle CI tests using d-separation relations in the ground-truth DAG. 2) CI tests on Gaussian data, using Fischer's inverse Z transform. Note that when using oracle CI tests, you should feed the function with the ground truth.
The function Generate_Data.m generates a graph, randomly permutes it, and then creates a data matrix conforming to this permuted graph, using a linear SEM. Specific real-world structures taken from the Bayes net repository are included in the folder "structures". Include this folder if you are using Generate_Data.m to generate data conforming to these structures.
The function learning_errors.m is used to compute the precision, recall, and F1 score of the algorithm.

See the file main.m for some examples of how to use these functions.
